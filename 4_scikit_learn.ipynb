    "## What Is scikit-learn?\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-learn provides a large range of algorithms in machine learning that are unified under a common and intuitive API. Most of the dozens of classes provided for various kinds of models share the large majority of the same calling interface. Very often you can easily substitute one algorithm for another with nearly no change in your underlying code. This allows you to explore the problem space quickly, and often arrive at an optimal, or at least satisficing$^1$ approach to your problem domain or datasets.\n",
